# Fanfie Project: Camera & Graphics Editor Implementation

## Current State of Implementation

The application currently implements a complete pipeline for capturing, editing, and sharing photos with graphics overlays:

1. **Camera Module**: Fully functional device camera access with responsive UI, error handling, and photo capture capabilities.
2. **Graphics Editor**: Interactive editor using Fabric.js for canvas manipulation with text overlay support, layering controls, and image export.
3. **Sharing System**: Multi-platform sharing with Web Share API support, social media integration, and download options.
4. **Complete User Flow**: Three-stage flow from capture â†’ edit â†’ share with appropriate transitions and state management.

## Component Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CameraComponent (`src/app/components/CameraComponent.tsx`)**
   - Client-side component handling camera stream access using `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`
   - Manages camera states: idle, accessing, streaming, error
   - Uses `canvas` for photo capture and conversion to data URL
   - Implements comprehensive error handling for various camera access failures

2. **GraphicsOverlay (`src/app/components/GraphicsOverlay.tsx`)**
   - Canvas-based image editor built on Fabric.js
   - Provides text overlay capabilities with font customization (size, family, color)
   - Implements layer management for stacking order of elements
   - Includes tools for element manipulation (add, delete, reposition)

3. **ShareComponent (`src/app/components/ShareComponent.tsx`)**
   - Handles multiple sharing options: Web Share API, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram
   - Provides export functionality in different formats (PNG/JPEG)
   - Implements clipboard operations for link sharing
   - Uses toast notifications for user feedback

4. **Main Page Integration (`src/app/page.tsx`)**
   - Orchestrates flow between the three components
   - Maintains application state using React hooks
   - Implements clean transitions between capture, edit, and share modes

### Architecture Decisions & Rationale

1. **Client Components with `use client` Directive**
   - All components use the `'use client'` directive to enable browser API access
   - Rationale: Necessary for camera API, canvas manipulation, and sharing features that require client-side execution

2. **Modular Component Structure**
   - Separation into distinct components with clear responsibilities
   - Rationale: Improves maintainability, enables independent testing, and follows single-responsibility principle

3. **Prop-Based Communication**
   - Components communicate through props and callbacks
   - Rationale: Creates clear data flow and makes component relationships explicit

4. **State Isolation**
   - Each component manages its internal state while the main page handles application-level state
   - Rationale: Reduces complexity and prevents state synchronization issues

## Technical Choices

### Key Technologies

1. **Fabric.js for Canvas Manipulation**
   - Chosen for its comprehensive object model and interactive capabilities
   - Provides built-in support for text, images, and object manipulation
   - Enables complex canvas operations with relatively simple code
   - Allows easy export of the final composition

2. **React State Management**
   - Uses React's built-in useState hooks for state management
   - Simple state model with mode transitions (capture â†’ edit â†’ share)
   - Passes image data between components through props and callbacks

3. **Media APIs**
   - `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` for camera access
   - Web Share API for native sharing where supported
   - Canvas API for image manipulation and format conversion

4. **UI Components**
   - Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
   - React Icons for consistent iconography
   - React Hot Toast for non-intrusive notifications

## Integration Patterns

1. **Parent-Child Coordination**
   - Main page acts as coordinator passing state and callbacks to child components
   - Child components report back changes through callback props
   - Example: `onCapture`, `onBack`, and `onSave` callbacks

2. **Conditional Rendering**
   - Components are conditionally rendered based on the current application mode:
     ```jsx
     {mode === 'capture' && <CameraComponent onCapture={handleCapture} />}
     {mode === 'edit' && capturedImage && <GraphicsOverlay image={capturedImage} ... />}
     {mode === 'share' && finalImage && <ShareComponent imageUrl={finalImage} ... />}
     ```

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Web Share API is used where available, with fallbacks for unsupported browsers
   - Canvas operations degrade gracefully with error handling

4. **Cleanup Pattern**
   - Resources are properly released using useEffect cleanup functions
   - Example: Camera stream is stopped when the component unmounts

## Implementation Decisions

1. **Camera Access Strategy**
   - Using front-facing camera by default (`facingMode: 'user'`)
   - Setting optimal resolution (1280Ã—720) as ideal but allowing browser to adjust
   - Rationale: Provides good quality while maximizing compatibility across devices

2. **Canvas Management**
   - Canvas dimensions match container for responsive design
   - Background image positioning preserves aspect ratio
   - Objects (text, etc.) are stored with unique IDs for manipulation
   - Rationale: Creates predictable behavior across various screen sizes

3. **Export Strategy**
   - PNG export preserves transparency
   - JPEG conversion with white background for compatibility
   - Custom naming with timestamps for organization
   - Rationale: Balances quality, compatibility, and user convenience

4. **Error Handling Approach**
   - Detailed error messages with friendly UI indicators
   - Toast notifications for transient feedback
   - Fallbacks for various error conditions
   - Rationale: Ensures users understand issues without technical jargon

## Current Context for Future Development

### Next Steps

1. **Sticker Library Implementation**
   - Infrastructure for stickers exists in the GraphicsOverlay component
   - Need to add sticker library UI and loading mechanism
   - Integration with Fabric.js objects is prepared through current architecture

2. **Advanced Text Effects**
   - Current text implementation is basic
   - Future work: text shadows, outlines, gradients, animations

3. **Filter System**
   - Framework exists for image manipulation
   - Add filter options using Fabric.js image filters or custom WebGL shaders

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Canvas rendering can be optimized for complex scenes
   - Lazy loading for resource-intensive components

### Current Limitations

1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Camera API requires HTTPS in production
   - Mobile browser variations may cause inconsistencies
   - Web Share API not universally supported

2. **Image Quality Management**
   - Need better balance between quality and performance
   - Consider implementing progressive loading for large images

3. **Testing Coverage**
   - Additional tests needed for component interactions
   - Mock implementations for camera and sharing APIs

## Architectural Considerations

The implementation follows a clear separation of concerns with independent components that communicate through props. This approach supports future expansions while maintaining a clean architecture. The use of Fabric.js provides a robust foundation for canvas operations with good browser support.

The three-stage workflow (capture â†’ edit â†’ share) creates a natural user journey while keeping the codebase organized around distinct responsibilities. This pattern can be extended to include additional stages or features without disrupting the existing implementation.

## Share Component Architecture

### Component Structure
The sharing functionality is built using a modal-based approach with multiple sharing options:

```tsx
interface ShareComponentProps {
  imageUrl: string;
  onClose: () => void;
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
}
```

### Design Decisions

1. **Modal Approach**
   - Full-screen modal with dark overlay
   - Centered content with max-width
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Keeps user focused on sharing task

2. **Share Options Hierarchy**
   - Native Share API (primary when available)
   - Social Media Quick Links
   - Download Options (PNG/JPEG)
   - Copy Link Fallback

3. **State Management**
   ```typescript
   const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
   const [canShare, setCanShare] = useState(false);
   ```
   - Minimal state usage
   - Loading states for feedback
   - Feature detection state

4. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Toast notifications for user feedback
   - Graceful fallbacks for all features
   - Clear error messages
   - Proper error logging

5. **Integration with Main Flow**
   ```tsx
   {editedImage ? (
     <ShareComponent 
       imageUrl={editedImage}
       onClose={handleClose}
     />
   ) : (
     <GraphicsOverlay ... />
   )}
   ```
   - Clean integration with edit flow
   - Clear state transitions
   - Proper cleanup on close

### Technical Considerations

1. **Server-Side Rendering**
   - Avoid hydration mismatches
   - Feature detection in useEffect
   - Conservative initial states

2. **Image Handling**
   - Proper image type conversion
   - Efficient blob handling
   - Memory cleanup

3. **Social Media Integration**

1. **Component Communication**
   ```typescript
   // Parent to ShareComponent
   onClose: () => void;
   // ShareComponent to External
   handleSocialShare: (platform: SharePlatform) => void;
   ```

2. **State Management**
   - Local state for UI
   - Props for data flow
   - Callbacks for events

3. **Error Boundaries**
   - Toast notifications
   - Error logging
   - User feedback

### Testing Considerations

# Fanfie Application Workflows

## Shot Preview Workflow (v1.2.0)

### Overview
- Introduced a new "shot" preview step between camera capture and editor
- Three distinct view states: camera â†’ shot â†’ editor
- Image upload is now explicitly triggered by Share button action

### Detailed Flow
1. **Camera View** 
   - User captures photo using CameraComponent
   - Photo is stored as base64 in `imageData` state
   - View transitions to Shot Preview

2. **Shot Preview**
   - Displays captured image
   - Provides two action buttons:
     - **Share**: Triggers upload to ImgBB and transitions to Editor
     - **Back**: Returns to Camera View, discarding the capture

3. **Editor View** 
   - Accessed only after successful upload
   - Shows uploaded image URL
   - Future editing functionality will be added here

### Technical Implementation
- New state variables:
  - `view`: Tracks current screen ("camera" | "shot" | "editor")
  - `imageData`: Stores base64 image between capture and upload
- Modified handlers:
  - `handleCapture`: Now only sets state (no upload)
  - `handleShare`: Handles ImgBB upload 

### Known Limitations
1. Large images (>5MB) may cause performance issues
2. No way to retry failed uploads (must go back to camera)
3. Image quality is currently reduced during base64 conversion

### Edge Cases Handled
- Missing API key validation before upload attempt
- Upload state management (loading indicators)
- Proper view state cleanup on Back action
