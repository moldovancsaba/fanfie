# Fanfie Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
Fanfie is a web application for capturing, editing, and sharing photos with graphical overlays. The project uses Next.js v15.2.4 with App Router, TypeScript, and Fabric.js v6.6.1 for canvas operations. It is hosted on Vercel and requires comprehensive testing.

## Technical Implementation
The current implementation uses:
- Next.js v15.2.4 with App Router
- React v19.0.0
- Fabric.js v6.6.1 for canvas operations

## Strategic Goals

### Immediate Term (Sprint 1-2)
1. **Stabilize Graphics Layer**
   - Implement Canvas Service abstraction
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Improve type safety with Fabric.js
   - Document all type workarounds

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement resource cleanup
   - Add memory usage monitoring
   - Optimize image loading
   - Improve error recovery

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Add canvas operation tests
   - Implement performance benchmarks
   - Add cross-browser testing
   - Create stress tests

### Medium Term (Sprint 3-5)
1. **Graphics Library Evaluation**
   - Research Konva.js capabilities
   - Create proof of concept
   - Run performance comparisons
   - Document findings

2. **Canvas Service Enhancement**
   - Abstract library-specific code
   - Implement standard interfaces
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Improve error handling

3. **Migration Planning**
   - If Konva.js proves better:
     * Design migration strategy
     * Plan phased replacement
     * Prepare fallback options
   - If staying with Fabric.js:
     * Optimize current implementation
     * Enhance type definitions
     * Improve documentation

### Long Term (Sprint 6+)
1. **Graphics Feature Expansion**
   - Add advanced editing tools
   - Implement animations
   - Add filter effects
   - Enhance text handling

2. **Performance Goals**
   - Sub-second image loading
   - Smooth editing experience
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Quick export operations
