### Browser Compatibility
- **Full Support**:
  - Chrome 76+ (desktop and mobile)
  - Firefox 79+ (desktop and mobile)
  - Edge 79+ (desktop)
  - Safari 15+ (desktop and mobile)
- **Partial Support**:
  - Safari 13-14: Camera works but some canvas features may be limited
  - Older Edge versions: Limited support for some CSS features
- **Not Supported**:
  - Internet Explorer (any version)
  - Browsers without MediaDevices API support

### Known Limitations
- Camera access requires HTTPS or localhost for security reasons
- Some mobile browsers may have limited camera resolution control
- Canvas operations can be memory-intensive on lower-end devices
- Web Share API is not available on all browsers; fallback mechanisms are provided
- Text editing capabilities are basic in this initial release
- Limited sticker options in the first version

### Component Architecture
The application is composed of three main components:

1. **CameraComponent** (`src/app/components/CameraComponent.tsx`)
   - Handles camera stream access and permission management
   - Provides UI for capture and retake functionality
   - Converts video frames to image data on capture

2. **GraphicsOverlay** (`src/app/components/GraphicsOverlay.tsx`)
   - Initializes Fabric.js canvas with captured image
   - Manages text and graphic object manipulation
   - Provides controls for customizing text properties
   - Handles canvas export to image data

3. **ShareComponent** (`src/app/components/ShareComponent.tsx`)
   - Provides multiple sharing options (social, download, copy)
   - Implements Web Share API with browser fallbacks
   - Handles export in different formats

These components are orchestrated in the main page (`src/app/page.tsx`), which manages the workflow state transitions between capture, edit, and share modes.

### Future Development
For upcoming releases, we plan to enhance Fanfie with:
- More advanced text effects and animations
- Expanded sticker library
- Filters and image adjustments
- Cloud storage integration
- User accounts and saved projects
