### Component Architecture
The application is composed of three main components:

1. **CameraComponent** (`src/app/components/CameraComponent.tsx`)
   - Handles camera stream access and permission management
   - Provides UI for capture and retake functionality
   - Converts video frames to image data on capture

2. **GraphicsOverlay** (`src/app/components/GraphicsOverlay.tsx`)
   - Initializes Fabric.js canvas with captured image
   - Manages text and graphic object manipulation
   - Provides controls for customizing text properties
   - Handles canvas export to image data

3. **ShareComponent** (`src/app/components/ShareComponent.tsx`)
   - Provides multiple sharing options (social, download, copy)
   - Implements Web Share API with browser fallbacks
   - Handles export in different formats

These components are orchestrated in the main page (`src/app/page.tsx`), which manages the workflow state transitions between capture, edit, and share modes.

### Future Development
For upcoming releases, we plan to enhance Fanfie with:
- More advanced text effects and animations
- Expanded sticker library
- Filters and image adjustments
- Cloud storage integration
- User accounts and saved projects
