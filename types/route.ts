/**
 * This file has been simplified as we now use Next.js built-in types for route handlers.
 * 
 * For route handlers, use the following Next.js types:
 * - NextRequest from 'next/server' for requests
 * - NextResponse from 'next/server' for responses
 * - Route segment config and other types from 'next/types'
