# Development Learnings

## Dev
- Next.js 13+ App Router requires careful consideration of component hierarchy and data flow
- TypeScript configuration optimized for Next.js needs specific compiler options

## Design
- App Router architecture promotes cleaner separation of concerns
- Component organization follows Next.js 13+ conventions

## Backend
- API routes follow the new App Router conventions
- Server Components provide enhanced performance capabilities

## Frontend
- New file-system based routing simplifies navigation structure
- Server and Client Components require strategic implementation

## Security
- 2024-01-17T10:30:00.000Z: Identified and fixed critical security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Implemented enhanced security measures for input validation
- Updated all packages to latest secure versions

## Process
- Documentation-first approach ensures better project maintainability
- Version control strategy aligned with semantic versioning

## Deployment
- 2024-01-17T12:45:00.000Z: Production deployment requires proper authentication setup for API endpoints
- Vercel deployment process requires environment variable configuration
- 2025-06-30T17:35:00.000Z: MongoDB connection optimization in production:
  - Simplified configuration by using only MONGODB_URI
  - Database name extracted directly from connection string
  - Successful data persistence and retrieval confirmed
  - Connection stability achieved in production environment
