To ensure every AI-led implementation is production-grade, documented, and traceable, supporting reliable continuation by anyone (AI or human). It formalises a zero-ambiguity workflow for sustainable product development.

ðŸ§¾ REQUIRED STEPS (all must be fulfilled):
	1.	Implement the requested feature, bug fix, change, or enhancement according to the specification.
	2.	Write and run tests:
	â€¢	Implement unit tests for logic-heavy modules.
	â€¢	Implement automated frontend tests (if applicable).
	â€¢	Perform manual testing to verify expected UI/UX behaviour.
	3.	Verify success locally and in production:
	â€¢	Ensure the implemented feature works as intended.
	â€¢	Ensure it does not break existing functionality.

	4.	Update documentation (all entries must be current):

README.md:
Reflect changes to usage, layout, interface behaviour, or system setup.

05_50FirstDates.MD:
Update the working state and current context so any new AI or developer can continue seamlessly without prior knowledge.

04_releasenotes.MD:
Add a new semantic version entry (e.g. v1.1.1) including:
	â€¢	Summary of the feature or fix
	â€¢	Reason for change
	â€¢	Technical notes or known side effects

03_lessonslearned.MD:
If relevant, document:
	â€¢	Errors encountered and how they were resolved
	â€¢	Design trade-offs or edge cases handled
	â€¢	Future safeguards or validations

	5.	Tag the Git commit with the new version (e.g. git tag -a v1.1.1 -m "Feature: new layout for camera").
	6.	Deploy to Vercel (Production) and confirm the deployment is successful:
	â€¢	Verify the production URL works as intended.
	â€¢	If deployment fails:
	â€¢	Identify root cause.
	â€¢	Fix the issue.
	â€¢	Repeat deployment and verification.
	â€¢	Update LESSONS_LEARNED.md with the incident if applicable.
	7.	Prepare for handover:
	â€¢	Ensure all documentation and code are self-contained and sufficient for AI or human continuation.
	â€¢	Avoid any uncommitted local logic, hidden assumptions, or undocumented changes.

âœ… OUTPUT FORMAT (must include all):
