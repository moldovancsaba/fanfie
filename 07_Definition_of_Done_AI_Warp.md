# Definition of Done (DoD) – AI Implementation Rule

**Applies To:** Every AI-generated feature, fix, enhancement, or change request.

---

## 🚨 RULE

**This rule is mandatory. No exceptions.** Every AI-led implementation must follow all steps without omission. This guarantees the implementation is **production-grade, test-verified, fully documented, versioned, deployed, and future-proofed** — enabling seamless continuation by any human or AI agent.

---

## ✅ DEFINITION OF DONE – MANDATORY STEPS

### 1. 🔧 Implementation
- Fully implement the requested **feature**, **fix**, or **enhancement** exactly as specified.
- Code must be **functional**, **clean**, and **self-contained**.

### 2. 🧪 Testing (All required forms must be performed)
- **Unit tests** for all logic-based or algorithmic components.
- **Automated frontend tests** (if the implementation affects UI).
- **Manual testing** for UI/UX behaviour and edge cases.
- All tests must pass. No partial success accepted.

### 3. ✅ Verification
- Locally: Confirm complete functionality.
- In production: Ensure the deployed version behaves as intended.
- Must not introduce **any regressions** or break existing features.

### 4. 📝 Documentation (Every section must be updated)
- `README.md` – Reflect setup, usage, interface changes, or logic shifts.
- `50FirstDates.MD` – Update full working context for next AI/human contributor.
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md` – Add new version entry (e.g. `v1.1.1`) including:
  - Summary of feature/fix
  - Reason for change
  - Technical notes, constraints, or side effects
- `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` – Document:
  - Errors, fixes, design trade-offs, safeguards (if applicable)

### 5. 🏷️ Git Versioning
- Tag the final commit using semantic versioning (e.g. `v1.1.1`)
- Include descriptive message (`-m "Feature: X"`)

### 6. 🚀 Deployment
- Deploy to **Vercel Production**
- Confirm the deployment:
  - Production URL must be **live and correct**
- On failure:
  - Identify and resolve root cause
  - Redeploy and reverify
  - Update `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` with incident details

### 7. 📦 Handover-Ready State
- All code and documentation must be:
  - **Self-contained**
  - **Clean**
  - **Free of assumptions**
  - **Ready for continuation** without additional context

---

## 📤 OUTPUT FORMAT – MUST CONTAIN ALL:

- ✅ **Full, working code** (no partial snippets)
- ✅ Updated:
  - `README.md`
  - `50FirstDates.MD`
  - `RELEASE_NOTES.md`
  - `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` (if applicable)
- ✅ **Deployed version** on Vercel (verified)
- ✅ Suggested **Git tag** (e.g. `v1.1.1`)

## 🎯 PURPOSE

To enforce a consistent, zero-ambiguity standard for AI-led product development. This ensures traceability, maintainability, and uninterrupted progress for any future contributor—human or AI.
