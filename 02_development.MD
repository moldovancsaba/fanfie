# Fanfie Project Development Details

## Project Purpose:
Develop a web application that allows users to access their camera, take pictures, overlay graphic elements, and share the edited images to an imgbb database via an API.

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (provides server-side rendering and easy deployment on Vercel)
- **UI Library:** React (for component-based architecture)
- **Language:** TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- **API Integration:** Use Fetch or Axios to interact with imgbb API
- **Graphics Layer:** Utilize HTML5 Canvas API or a library like Fabric.js to add graphics overlays to images

## Implementation Steps:

1. **Set up the Development Environment:**
   - Initialize a new Next.js project
   - Configure TypeScript support

2. **Implement Camera Access:**
   - Use web APIs to request camera access and capture images

3. **Graphics Overlay:**
   - Integrate an HTML5 canvas or a graphics library for manipulating images

4. **API Integration:**
   - Set up API connections to upload images to the imgbb database

5. **Testing and Iteration:**
   - Test each step thoroughly to ensure functionality and performance
   - Continuously refine and enhance features based on test results
   - Test each step thoroughly to ensure functionality and performance
   - Continuously refine and enhance features based on test results

## Graphics Layer Implementation

### Current Approach (as of v1.1.3)
- **Primary Library**: Fabric.js
- **Implementation Pattern**:
  ```typescript
  // Recommended implementation pattern
  const { fabric } = await import('fabric');
  fabric.Image.fromURL(
      url,
      (img) => {
          // Handle image load
      },
      { crossOrigin: 'anonymous' }
  );
  ```

### Known Challenges
1. **Type System Integration**
   - TypeScript definitions may not perfectly match runtime behavior
   - Requires careful type assertions and custom type definitions
   - Need for explicit error handling

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Memory management for large images
   - Resource cleanup requirements
   - Canvas state management

### Future Development Path
1. **Short Term (Current)**
   - Continue with Fabric.js
   - Implement Canvas Service abstraction
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Improve type safety

2. **Medium Term (Next 2-3 Sprints)**
   - Evaluate Konva.js as alternative
   - Create proof of concept
   - Compare performance metrics
   - Make migration decision

### Development Guidelines
1. **Type Safety**
   - Always use proper type assertions
   - Validate all parameters
   - Handle edge cases explicitly

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement try-catch blocks
   - Provide user feedback
   - Log errors for debugging

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests for canvas operations
   - Integration tests for image handling
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Cross-browser compatibility

4. **Documentation**
   - Update technical documentation
   - Document type workarounds
   - Maintain troubleshooting guide
