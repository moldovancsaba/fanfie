# Fanfie Project Development Details

## Project Purpose:
Develop a web application that allows users to access their camera, take pictures, overlay graphic elements, and share the edited images to an imgbb database via an API.

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (provides server-side rendering and easy deployment on Vercel)
- **UI Library:** React (for component-based architecture)
- **Language:** TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- **API Integration:** Use Fetch or Axios to interact with imgbb API
- **Graphics Layer:** Utilize HTML5 Canvas API or a library like Fabric.js to add graphics overlays to images

## Implementation Steps:

1. **Set up the Development Environment:**
   - Initialize a new Next.js project
   - Configure TypeScript support

2. **Implement Camera Access:**
   - Use web APIs to request camera access and capture images

3. **Graphics Overlay:**
   - Integrate an HTML5 canvas or a graphics library for manipulating images

4. **API Integration:**
   - Set up API connections to upload images to the imgbb database

5. **Testing and Iteration:**
   - Test each step thoroughly to ensure functionality and performance
   - Continuously refine and enhance features based on test results
