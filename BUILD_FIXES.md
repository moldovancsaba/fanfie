## 2024-01-09 - Next.js Font System and Babel Conflict Resolution

### Issue
The production build was failing due to a conflict between Next.js's font system (`next/font`) and custom Babel configuration. The error message indicated that `next/font` requires SWC (Next.js's rust-based compiler) although Babel was being used due to the presence of a custom babel config.

### Resolution
1. Backed up existing Babel configuration:
   - Moved `.babelrc` to `.babelrc.backup`
   - This allows us to reference the old config if needed

2. Switched to SWC compiler:
   - By removing the Babel configuration, we allowed Next.js to use its default SWC compiler
   - This is the recommended approach for better performance
   - The font system now works correctly with the Inter font in the layout

### Previous Babel Configuration (for reference)
```json
{
  "assumptions": {
    "setSpreadProperties": true
  },
  "presets": [
    ["next/babel", {
      "preset-env": {
        "modules": "commonjs",
        "targets": {
          "node": "current"
        }
      },
      "transform-runtime": {
        "regenerator": true
      }
    }]
  ]
}
```

### Verification
- Production build completes successfully
- All pages are compiled and optimized
- Font system works correctly in the layout
- Route structure maintained with proper static and dynamic routes

### Build Output Summary
- Successfully compiled in 3.0s
- All TypeScript types verified
- All pages generated (23/23)
- Route optimizations completed
- Total shared JS bundle size: 101 kB
- Middleware size: 38.7 kB

### Note
If any server-side code specifically requires CommonJS modules or specific Node.js targets, we may need to implement alternative solutions without relying on Babel. Monitor for any issues related to server-side code that might have depended on the previous Babel configuration.
