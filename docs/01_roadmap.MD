  - Documentation includes text feature usage

#### Feature 7: Filters and Effects
- Implement basic image filters (B&W, sepia, etc.)
- Add brightness/contrast adjustments
- Create filter preview mechanism
- **Testing Checkpoint**: Test filter application and performance
- **Definition of Done**:

  - Storage limits are implemented
  - Images can be deleted from history
  - UI is responsive at various screen sizes

#### Feature 10: Performance Optimizations
- Implement lazy loading for resources
- Add image compression options
- Optimize canvas rendering
- **Testing Checkpoint**: Performance testing on various devices
- **Definition of Done**:
  - Application loads faster with optimizations
  - Large images handle smoothly
  - Documentation includes performance metrics
  - Fallbacks for low-powered devices
## Testing Protocol for Each Feature

To maintain high quality and ensure features are production-ready, each feature will follow this testing protocol:

1. **Developer Testing**
   - Unit testing where applicable
   - Manual feature testing by developer
   - Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

2. **Manual Verification Session**
   - Live demo of the feature
   - Verification of all acceptance criteria
   - Testing of error states and edge cases
   - Verification on mobile and desktop devices

3. **Documentation Review**
   - Update to all documentation before moving to next feature
   - Clear instructions on feature usage
   - Update to lessons learned document

## Definition of Done for All Features

A feature is only considered complete when:

1. Code is fully implemented and working without errors
2. Manual testing has been performed and documented
3. All edge cases have been handled
4. Documentation has been updated
5. Code has been committed with a clear message
6. The feature has been verified in production environment

## Technologies To Evaluate

- Konva.js as an alternative to Fabric.js for canvas manipulation
- WebRTC advanced features for better camera control
- Web Workers for performance-intensive operations
- IndexedDB for local image storage

## Future Feature Requests

- Collage creation
- Animated overlays/GIFs
- Offline support
- Social sharing integrations
- Custom filter creation
