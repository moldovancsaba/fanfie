# Fanfie - Project Context and Current State

This document maintains a continuously updated record of the project's state and context to facilitate seamless continuation by anyone working on the project.

## Current State (2025-04-06)

### Project Status
- **Phase:** Camera Implementation - Basic Functionality Complete
- **Version:** v0.2.0
- **Latest Deployment:** Not yet deployed to production

### Recently Completed
- Successfully implemented simplified camera component (SimpleCameraComponent.tsx)
- Established clean, minimal approach focused only on core functionality
- Implemented proper camera permission handling with three states:
  - 'requesting': Initial state while asking for permission
  - 'granted': Camera access allowed, displaying video feed
  - 'denied': Permission denied with appropriate error message
- Added proper MediaStream cleanup on component unmount
- Established clear manual testing protocol

### Current Status of Camera Component
- Basic camera permissions and video display working
- Component successfully simplified to core functionality
- Manual testing confirmed working in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- Error handling implemented for common camera access issues

### Next Immediate Tasks (Feature 1: Photo Capture)
- Add photo capture functionality to the SimpleCameraComponent
- Implement capture button with appropriate UI feedback
- Create temporary photo preview functionality
- Add discard/retake capability
- Manually test all camera capture functionality

### Definition of Done for Photo Capture
- [ ] Photo capture works in all supported browsers
- [ ] Captured photos display correctly in preview
- [ ] UI provides clear feedback during capture process
- [ ] Photos are properly oriented (mirrored for selfies)
- [ ] Documentation updated with implementation details
- [ ] All manual test cases pass
- [ ] Code committed with clear message

### Manual Testing Requirements
- Test photo capture on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Test on mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Verify photo quality and orientation
- Test error handling if capture fails

## Technical Context

### Project Structure
The project follows Next.js 14 App Router conventions:
- `/src/app/` - Core application code
- `/src/app/components/` - Reusable components
- `/src/app/components/Camera/` - Camera functionality

### Key Components
- `SimpleCameraComponent.tsx` - Handles camera permission requests and video display
- (Next) Photo capture implementation in SimpleCameraComponent.tsx
- (Future) `EditorComponent.tsx` - Will handle image editing with Fabric.js
- (Future) `ShareComponent.tsx` - Will handle image sharing functionality

### Current Camera Component Implementation
The SimpleCameraComponent now includes:
- `'use client'` directive for client-side functionality
- Simple three-state permission management ('requesting', 'granted', 'denied')
- Direct use of navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() without third-party libraries
- Native HTML video element for display (no Webcam library)
- Proper cleanup of camera stream on component unmount
- Specific error handling for different camera permission scenarios
- Approximately 90 lines of code, focused solely on core functionality

### Browser Compatibility Status
- Confirmed working on:
  - Chrome (desktop)
  - Firefox (desktop)
  - Safari (desktop)
- To be tested on:
  - Mobile Safari (iOS)
  - Mobile Chrome (Android)
  - Edge (desktop)

### Implementation Notes
- Camera access requires HTTPS or localhost
- Component uses React's useEffect and useState hooks for state management
- Video element uses autoPlay and playsInline attributes for immediate playback
- Error handling differentiates between NotAllowedError, NotFoundError, and NotReadableError

### Current Limitations
- No camera switching functionality (front/back)
- No photo capture capability yet
- No camera resolution controls
- Basic styling only

## Development Plan for Next Feature

### Photo Capture Implementation (Single Function Focus)
1. Add canvas-based capture from video element
2. Create capture button with appropriate UI feedback
3. Implement photo preview with temporary state
4. Add discard functionality
5. Test across browsers before moving to next feature
