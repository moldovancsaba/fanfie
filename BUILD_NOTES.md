# Build Notes and Optimization Opportunities

## Build Warnings and Recommendations

### Standalone Output Configuration
The current configuration uses `output: 'standalone'` in `next.config.js`, which requires a different startup command in production:

```bash
# Instead of npm run start, use:
node .next/standalone/server.js
```

### MongoDB Connection Management
The production build shows frequent connection recycling, indicated by multiple "Cached connection is stale, reconnecting..." messages. Consider the following optimizations:

1. Implement connection pooling
2. Add connection timeout and retry strategies
3. Consider using a connection management library like `mongoose-connection-manager`

## Type System Improvements
During the build process, several TypeScript issues were encountered with Next.js route typing. Current workarounds use type assertions (`as any`), which could be improved by:

1. Creating proper route type definitions
2. Using Next.js's built-in route typing system
3. Implementing a centralized route management system

## Build Statistics
- First Load JS shared by all: 88.8 kB
- Total Routes: 21
  - Static Routes: 8
  - Dynamic Routes: 13
- Largest Routes:
  - /projects: 117 kB
  - /organizations: 116 kB
  - /projects/[id]: 109 kB

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Route Size Optimization**
   - Consider code splitting for large routes
   - Analyze and reduce unused imports
   - Implement dynamic imports for heavy components

2. **Database Connection Management**
   - Implement proper connection pooling
   - Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Monitor connection lifecycle events

3. **Type System**
   - Replace `as any` type assertions with proper types
   - Create route type definitions
   - Implement strict type checking for navigation

4. **Build Configuration**
   - Update npm scripts to support standalone output mode
   - Add production environment validation
   - Implement build size monitoring
